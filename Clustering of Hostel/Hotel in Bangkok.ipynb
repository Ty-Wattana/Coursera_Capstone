The city offers\nthe tourist many historical and cultural sights to see, dynamic nightlife shopping and relaxation.\nHowever local experience travel is one of five travel trends for 2020, the travelers want to find\nauthentic experiences. Many travelers prefer privacy and a comfortable way of renting their own\naccommodations in private apartments or houses. The guesthouse is a new trend of accommodation\nfor travelers who desire simple accommodation and local experience during their stay and also in\norder to avoid crowded places and the tourist masses. In Bangkok there are a lot of places and\ncommunities to explore, thus guesthouse promotion policy is essential for building a new tourism\ninfrastructure to attract the new trend of tourism."

For example, the\ncluster with the highest number of guesthouses may have a lot of goods and services venue\ncategory in their area while the other cluster with fewer guesthouses may facing an\nabsence of goods and services venue in their area. This data insight can indicate that food venues are essential\nfor establishing the guesthouse and essential for backpacker rental decisions. City planners or\npolicymakers can use this analysis to form guesthouse promotion policy as well as guesthouse\nentrepreneurs who can use this analysis to find the optimal location to settle their guesthouse."
